# Oil Lamp Tree Setup

## Important: Add the Tree Image

Please save your tree silhouette image as:
`public/tree.png`

The tree image should be:
- A silhouette (dark/black) on transparent background
- High resolution for best quality
- Portrait or square orientation works best

The app will automatically use it as the background with lamps positioned on the branches.

```bash
npm run dev

Then open your browser to the URL shown (usually http://localhost:5173)

- Dark, spiritual background with your tree silhouette
